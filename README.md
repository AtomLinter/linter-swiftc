linter-swiftc
=========================

This linter plugin for [Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) provides an interface to Swift's builtin syntax analysis. It will be used with files that have the `Swift` syntax.

This may only be used on systems running OS X Maverics or later and have Xcode Develpers Tools installed.

## Installation
Linter package must be installed in order to use this plugin. If Linter is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).

### Plugin installation
```
$ apm install linter-swiftc
```

## Settings
Using the Settings for the Package you may change the state of any of these properties to change how files are linted:
- `Live Linting` when enabled lints the current state of the current file in a temporary directory, this breaks relative requirements, but this mode is useful if writing a script. When disabled the file is linted in the directory it's saved in at save and opening, keeping in tact relative requirements.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute enhancements or fixes, please do the following:

1. Fork the plugin repository.
1. Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master`.
1. Commit and push the topic branch.

Please note that modifications should follow these coding guidelines:

- Code should pass coffeelint linter.
- Vertical whitespace helps readability, donâ€™t be afraid to use it.

Thank you for helping out!
